## Question 8: College.csv

1. `read.csv()` + `rownames()`

```{r}
college <- read.csv("College.csv", header=T, na.strings="?")
```

2. 

```{r}
rownames(college)=college[,1]
college=college[,-1]
#fix(college)
```

3. 
  + `summary()`

```{r}
summary(college)
```

  + `pairs()`

```{r}
pairs(college[,1:10])
```

  + side-by-side box plots

```{r}
attach(college)
Private=as.factor(Private)
boxplot(Outstate, Private, col="red", varwidth=T, xlab="Private", ylab="Out of State")
```

  + binning
  
```{r}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc > 50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(college,Elite)
summary(Elite)
boxplot(Outstate,Elite,col="red",xlab="Elite",ylab="Out of State")
```

  + `hist()`
  
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(Outstate,col="red",breaks=2)
hist(Outstate,col="red",breaks=5)
hist(Outstate,col="red",breaks=10)
hist(Outstate,col="red",breaks=15)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(Accept,col="red",breaks=2)
hist(Accept,col="red",breaks=5)
hist(Accept,col="red",breaks=10)
hist(Accept,col="red",breaks=15)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(Expend,col="red",breaks=2)
hist(Expend,col="red",breaks=5)
hist(Expend,col="red",breaks=10)
hist(Expend,col="red",breaks=15)
```

  + exploration
  
```{r}
plot(Apps,Accept,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there seems to be a positive relationship between the number of applications received and the number of applicants accepted.

```{r}
plot(Room.Board,Books,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there does not seem to be a relationship between the cost of room & board and the estimated cost of books.

```{r}
plot(PhD,S.F.Ratio,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there does not seem to be a relationship between the percent of faculy with Ph.D.'s and the student/faculty ratio.

## Question 9: Auto data

1. Quanitative vs. qualitative predictors

```{r}
Auto=read.table("Auto.data.txt",header=T,na.strings="?")
#fix(Auto)
```

Quanitative: mpg, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year

Qualitative: cylinders, origin, name

2. `range()`

```{r}
attach(Auto)
range(mpg)
range(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
range(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
range(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
range(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
range(year, na.rm=TRUE)
```

3. `mean()` and `sd()`

```{r}
mean(mpg, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(mpg, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(year, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(year, na.rm=TRUE)
```

4. 

```{r}
Auto_rm <- Auto[-c(10:85),]
attach(Auto_rm)

range(mpg)
range(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
range(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
range(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
range(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
range(year, na.rm=TRUE)

mean(mpg, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(mpg, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(displacement, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(horsepower, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(acceleration, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(year, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(year, na.rm=TRUE)
```

5. exploration

```{r}
attach(Auto)
```

```{r}
plot(weight,horsepower,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there seems to be a positive relationship between weight and horsepower.

```{r}
plot(horsepower,acceleration,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there seems to be a negative relationship between horsepower and acceleration.

```{r}
plot(mpg,horsepower,col="red")
```

By viewing the scatterplot, there seems to be a negative relationship between mpg and horsepower.

6. The relationship between mpg and horsepower looks quite strong, so horsepower may be a good predictor for mpg.

## Question 10: Boston housing

1. 

```{r}
library(MASS)
#Boston
dim(Boston)
#fix(Boston)
```

There are 506 rows and 14 columns.

The rows are observations, each being a town. Each column is a variable that may affect the housing value for each town, such at the per capita crime rate by town or the average number of rooms per dwelling.

2. 

```{r}
attach(Boston)
pairs(Boston)
```

I don't see any clear patterns in this format.

3. 

There seems there may be a relationship between per capita crime rate and average age, median value of owner-occupied homes, and weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers.

4. 

```{r}
hist(crim,col="red",breaks=15)
hist(tax,col="red",breaks=15)
hist(ptratio,col="red",breaks=15)
```

There is a spike in crime rates early in the observations. 

The tax rates seem pretty evenly distributed. 

The pupil ratio also haa a spike, but it's farther down in the list of observations.

5. 

```{r}
charles_bound=Boston[chas == 1,]
dim(charles_bound)
```

6. 

```{r}
median(ptratio)
```

7. 

```{r}
min(medv)
min_index = which.min(medv)
min_index

for (i in 1:ncol(Boston)){
  print(paste(colnames(Boston)[i]))
  print(paste("Value = ",Boston[min_index,i]))
  print(paste("Range = ",range(Boston[,i])))}
```

Value falls in the middle of the crim range, in the middle of indus, in the middle/high-end of nox, in the middle of the rm, is the max of age, on the low-end of dis, on the high-end of tax, on the high-end of ptratio, the max of black, on the high-end of lstat, and minimum of mdev.

8. 

```{r}
seven_rooms=Boston[rm > 7,]
dim(seven_rooms)
eight_rooms=Boston[rm > 8,]
dim(eight_rooms)
eight_rooms
```

The dwellings with more than eight rooms are almost entirely built before the 1940s.
